A slow start, but I'm having a hard time finding my spot this morning. I've been staring at the react fundementals and I need to add the pints functionality and I'm slow going on this.
rereading some lessons and some googles.

9:05 - I have somehow manage to break the sodaDetail even tho I haven't made any changes yet this morning that would break the code. Starting with ths problem first.

9:45 - I'm so stuck on this ID thing, and its so frustrating. I've tried going through the lewssons with UUID and it appears Im importsing everything correctly and sodalist newsodaform and now in soda control trying to figure how I'm targeting it wrong

10:00 - Yay. I found the missing piece in the sodacontrol. After i was miss ` === id` and thats was causing it.

11:00 - Have been building out the funtion to sell cans of soda and had run into a problem with where to put the button. I was trying to add it to the soda list for each soda so you wouldn't have to click on each soda to have the ability to sell 1 soda. But for the last helf hour or so tryin to accomplish that, I'm setting that aside for now and just adding the sell soda to the details view.

11:42 - Doing some planning, I'm now lost as to where this function should go. It's not going to be its own state to sell soda, it should just be a button that subtracts 1 from cansRemaining. So now its about figuring out where. Since editing a soda is a state, updating state with events is what im rereading now.

1:30 - I don't know why this is so hard for me. I thought I was getting how React could change and update state and update the props but I'm still stuck on getting this button to change the remainingCans.

1:40 - I see i might be calling the function incorrectly...

2:25 - Lost in the sauce yet again. I'm thinking of shelving this proj for the rest of the day and maybe fill out another resume cover letter, I'm taking ten or fifteen and coming back.

3:30 - I tried to figure out the way to write the method, I tried to go the route of just changing the soldSoda state applying it to the MasterSodaList, then tried to address the remainingCans by creating a function that changed the prop itself without changing the state. Both routes have lead to confusion and I was hoping this weeks work (and assistance) with incorporating firestone into a blank proj would help straighten out what I might be missing; I did understand how to connect the database and had trouble writing functions that were able to query and update as well. I found out that with a multnomah library card you can access the some really professional resources like Lynda.com for free. I'm thinking of watching thier react fundementals and seeing if I can patch what ever it is i'm lagging on in certain react concepts.

4:45 - The video series I found on React is nice, but i'm still not any closer right now with implementing the sellSoda and what's the best way. I'm requesting a meeting and hopefully talk through this if I haven't solved this soon.
