A slow start, but I'm having a hard time finding my spot this morning. I've been staring at the react fundementals and I need to add the pints functionality and I'm slow going on this.
rereading some lessons and some googles.

9:05 - I have somehow manage to break the sodaDetail even tho I haven't made any changes yet this morning that would break the code. Starting with ths problem first.

9:45 - I'm so stuck on this ID thing, and its so frustrating. I've tried going through the lewssons with UUID and it appears Im importsing everything correctly and sodalist newsodaform and now in soda control trying to figure how I'm targeting it wrong

10:00 - Yay. I found the missing piece in the sodacontrol. After i was miss ` === id` and thats was causing it.

11:00 - Have been building out the funtion to sell cans of soda and had run into a problem with where to put the button. I was trying to add it to the soda list for each soda so you wouldn't have to click on each soda to have the ability to sell 1 soda. But for the last helf hour or so tryin to accomplish that, I'm setting that aside for now and just adding the sell soda to the details view.

11:42 - Doing some planning, I'm now lost as to where this function should go. It's not going to be its own state to sell soda, it should just be a button that subtracts 1 from cansRemaining. So now its about figuring out where. Since editing a soda is a state, updating state with events is what im rereading now.

1:30 - I don't know why this is so hard for me. I thought I was getting how React could change and update state and update the props but I'm still stuck on getting this button to change the remainingCans.

1:40 - I see i might be calling the function incorrectly...

2:25 - Lost in the sauce yet again. I'm thinking of shelving this proj for the rest of the day and maybe fill out another resume cover letter, I'm taking ten or fifteen and coming back.
