A slow start, but I'm having a hard time finding my spot this morning. I've been staring at the react fundementals and I need to add the pints functionality and I'm slow going on this.
rereading some lessons and some googles.

9:05 - I have somehow manage to break the sodaDetail even tho I haven't made any changes yet this morning that would break the code. Starting with ths problem first.

9:45 - I'm so stuck on this ID thing, and its so frustrating. I've tried going through the lewssons with UUID and it appears Im importsing everything correctly and sodalist newsodaform and now in soda control trying to figure how I'm targeting it wrong

10:00 - Yay. I found the missing piece in the sodacontrol. After i was miss ` === id` and thats was causing it.
